## Get Jmol/JSmol
#(read carefully before you click ANYTHING on sourceforge pages, even download page)
#jmol.sourceforge.net/download
#-click download link (.zip file)
#-unzip the downloaded file
#-go into the directory that was created from unzipping
#-(Windows) open jmol.bat/ (Mac/Linux) open jmol.sh
#--if you don't have Java installed, get it from www.java.com/en/download/
#--click Free Java Download button
#(Make sure to unselect additional software that Java wants to add)
### Jmol stand alone
#-click File from menu
#-select Get PDB
#-enter a PDB ID (3HIZ, shows PIK3CA & PIK3R1)
#-if you want the console or script editors, these are selected from the File menu as well
#
## Science Olympiad Protein Modeling
### Jmol/JSmol Commands
#backbone only; #shows thin string of the structure along the alpha carbons(changing from ball&stick format)
#backbone 1.5; #shows the structure with thickness 1.5Angstrom (make sure you always use decimal values, must have "." between two numbers)
#color cpk; #colors atoms by element and as spheres
#restrict a-b and chain=A; #shows only residues a-b of chain A
#select a; #selects only residue a
#select a; spacefill; #selects only residue a & shows its atoms as spheres (size of van der waals radius)
#select all; #selects all residues
#color structure; #colors secondary structures, alpha helices (magenta) & beta sheets (orange)
#color chain; #colors structure by subunits
#
## Measurements
#-click Tools from menu
#-select Distance Units & the unit desired (Nanometers 1nm=10^-9m, Angstroms 1A=10^-10m, or Picometers 1pm=10^-12m)
#-click the Ruler icon from menu (don't worry about the Measurements popup for now)
#-click the background of the structure
#-click a start point (some atom)
#-click an end point (some other atom)
#Note the hashed line between the two points and the measurement displayed at its middle. This measurement also appears in the Measurements popup that we previously disregarded.
#
### General Notes
#left-clicking structure allows zoom (up=zoom out, down=zoom in)
#shift+left-clicking structure allows translation
#alt+left-clicking allows rotation about z-axis (orthogonal to the screen)
#when opening the editor, remove the "<no data>" line before running
#"#" starts comments, pieces of code that are not executed with commands
#hovering over an atom shows the following: [residue name abbreviation, 3letters]residue position:atom:atom type #atom number
#clicking on an atom displays this information AND the coordinates in the console window

## Reading PDB files
### Notes from Confluence - Ding Lab Wiki/Ding Lab Wiki Home/Software Tools and Pipelines/HotSpot3D/HotSpot3D: README Usage & Module Descriptions/PDB Structure File Format (.pdb)
#.pdb files are separated into groups according to char lengths (see PDB Format description). Each line is a maximum of 80 chars long. Each line begins with a "Record" (ATOM, HETATM, etc.) followed by that Record's specific information in each char group.
#    The most used Records used are ATOM & HETATM, their char group descriptions are:
#
#### ATOM (from the PDB Format link above):
#Contains: the atomic coordinates for standard residues and the occupancy and temperature factor for each atom Notes:
#	ATOM records for proteins are listed from amino to carboxyl terminus.
#	Nucleic acid residues are listed from the 5' to the 3' terminus.
#	No ordering is specified for polysaccharides.
#	The list of ATOM records in a chain is terminated by a TER record.
#	If an atom is provided in more than one position, then a non-blank alternate location indicator must be used. Within a residue, all atoms of a given conformation are assigned the same alternate position indicator.
#	Additional atoms (modifying group) to side chains of standard residues are represented as a HET group which is assigned its own residue name. The chainID, sequence number, and insertion code assigned to the HET group is that of the standard residue to which it is attached.
#	In some entries, the occupancy and temperature factor fields may be used for other quantities.
#	The segment identifier is a string of up to four (4) alphanumeric characters, left-justified, and may include a space, e.g., CH86, A 1, NASE.

#### HETATM (from the PDB Format link above):
#Contains: the atomic coordinate records for atoms within "non-standard" groups. These records are used for water molecules and atoms presented in HET groups. Notes:
#	Insertion codes, segment id, and element naming are fully described in the ATOM section of this document.
#	Disordered solvents may be represented by the residue name DIS.
#	No ordering is specified for polysaccharides.
#	HETATM records must have corresponding HET, HETNAM, FORMUL and CONECT records, except for waters.
